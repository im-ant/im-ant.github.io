### [Dumb_ChatBot](https://github.com/im-ant/Dumb_ChatBot)
A dumb, albeit entertaining chat bot to waste your time.

You may think it is just putting together random words as replies, but it is in fact spitting :fire::fire::fire: Shakespearean prose at you.

### [ClinVar_PathoID](https://github.com/im-ant/ClinVar_PathoID)
With rapid advances in genomics, techniques such as next-generation sequencing allows for the rapid and accurate sequencing of entire genomes. Mutations can be identified from these genome-wide sequencing for disease identification and treatment.

ClinVar is an openly available online database at the National Center for Biotechnology Information that allows physicians and researchers to look up genetic mutations and their effect on health. However, genome-wide data contains 10,000+ genes. Manual search of mutations is tedious, error-prone, and simply unfeasible at a larger scale.

The ClinVar Pathogenicity Finder (*ClinVar_PathoID*) is a tool for large-scale analysis of mutation statuses and identification of pre-existing disease conditions. It accesses the ClinVar database and retrieves information in an automated fashion, resulting in huge improvements in efficiency and enhancements to clinical and research capabilities.

Please refer to the github page for specifics regarding the Pathogenicity Finder.
