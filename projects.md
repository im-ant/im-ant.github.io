### [ClinVar_PathoID](https://github.com/im-ant/ClinVar_PathoID)
With rapid advances in genomics, advance techniques such as next-generation sequencing allows for the rapid and accurate sequencing of entire genomes. Mutations and diseases can then be identified from those genome-wide sequencings for personalized treatment.

ClinVar is one of such databases for geneticists to look up specific mutations and associated diseases. However, this is difficult to do on a large scale, especially for large-scale analysis and research.

The ClinVar Pathogenicity Finder (ClinVar_PathoID) is a tool for large-scale analysis of mutation statuses (e.g. pathogenic vs. benign), and identifies pre-existing disease conditions. This allows for huge speed-up in efficiency, improving clinical and research capabilities. 

Please refer to the github page for specifics regarding the input format and options.
