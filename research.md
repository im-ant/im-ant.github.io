# Research in Reinforcement Learning

Presently, I am a master's student in Computer Science at McGill and Mila, co-supervised by [Dr. Blake Richards](http://linclab.org/) and [Dr. Joelle Pineau](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jpineau/). Principally, I am interested in the area of machine learning known as [reinforcement learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning). As I've spent most of my undergrad studying Neuroscience, I also have an interest in brain-inspired artificial intelligence.

Throughout my undergrad, I have had the fortune to work with a number of researchers: [Dr. Yannis Trakadis](https://rimuhc.ca/-/yannis-trakadis) in psychiatric genomics, [Dr. Mallar Chakravarty](http://cobralab.ca/) in computational neuroscience and neuroimaging, and [Prof. Karl Friston](https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/~karl/) in theoretical neuroscience. These experiences have given me an appreciation for the wide variety of perspectives in the biological and neural-sciences.

## Other works

**Sept. 2019**: I won 2nd prize in the _Brain@McGill  Prize for Undergraduate Research_, for my research on modelling **Cognitive Decline Trajectories in Alzheimer's disease** (short [essay](https://www.mcgill.ca/brain/funding-students-postdocs/bm-prize-undergraduate-research/2019-brainmcgill-undergraduate-prize/2nd-prize-anthony-chen) on the findings), with an invited presentation given at the McGill IPN retreat.

**May 2019**: I worked on a theoretical neuroscience project modelling habit formation from a Bayesian perspective ([bioRxiv preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/644807v1)).


**Aug. 2017**: I won 1st place at the [Douglas undergraduate research expo](https://douglas.research.mcgill.ca/awards) with my poster presentation on **"In-Vivo Parcellation of the Human Thalamus using Multimodal Microstructural Data"** ([poster](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~achen43/public_files/Anthony_DouglasUndergradExpo_Poster.pdf)).
