I am currently a master's student in computer science in Montreal, Canada. At [McGill University](http://rl.cs.mcgill.ca/) and the [Mila Institute](https://mila.quebec/en/person/anthony-chen/).

Previously, I completed my undergraduate also at McGill, majoring in [Neuroscience](https://www.mcgill.ca/neuroscience/programs/major).
