I am currently a master's student in computer science at [McGill](http://rl.cs.mcgill.ca/) and [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/person/anthony-chen/). I am broadly interested in reinforcement learning.

Previously, I completed my undergraduate at McGill, majoring in [Neuroscience](https://www.mcgill.ca/neuroscience/programs/major).

Feel free to reach out to me LinkedIn, or you can find me on Twitter.
