Hello! My name is Anthony.

I am currently a master's student in computer science in Montreal, Canada. At [McGill University](http://rl.cs.mcgill.ca/) and the [Mila Institute](https://mila.quebec/en/person/anthony-chen/). Previously, I completed my undergraduate also at McGill, majoring in [Neuroscience](https://www.mcgill.ca/neuroscience/programs/major).



This website is a sort of a variety pack of my professional and personal interests. I have pursued a few paths over the past few years: neuroscientist, software engineer, data scientist, and machine learning researcher. Please be patient with me as I figure out my professional identity :)


I have organized this website depending on what you would like to find out.

The
<a href="{{ "/research/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">Research</a>
page will give an overview of my research interest and works.

My [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anthonygxchen/) will give you a good overview of the experiences I have, from school, in tech and in research.

My [GitHub](https://github.com/im-ant) will contain all of the tech-related (and some research-related) projects I have done, and fun personal ones!

I also have a [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AntChen_), which I use mostly to keep up to date with the scientific circle.
