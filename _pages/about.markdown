Hello! My name is Anthony.

![great wall](../assets/great-wall-wild.jpg)



This website is a sort of a variety pack of my professional and personal interests. I have pursued a few paths over the past few years: neuroscientist, software engineer, data scientist, and machine learning researcher. Please be patient with me as I figure out my professional identity :)




I have organized this website depending on what you would like to find out.

The
<a href="{{ "/research/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">Research</a>
page will give an overview of my research interest and works.

My [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anthonygxchen/) will give you a good overview of the experiences I have, from school, in tech and in research.

My [GitHub](https://github.com/im-ant) will contain all of the tech-related (and some research-related) projects I have done, and fun personal ones!

I also have a [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AntChen_), which I use mostly to keep up to date with the scientific circle.
