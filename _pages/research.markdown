Presently, I am a master's student in Computer Science at McGill and Mila, co-supervised by [Dr. Blake Richards](http://linclab.org/) and [Dr. Joelle Pineau](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jpineau/). Principally, I am interested in the area of machine learning known as [reinforcement learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning). As I've spent most of my undergrad studying Neuroscience, I also have an interest in brain-inspired artificial intelligence.

Throughout my undergrad, I have had the fortune to work with a number of researchers: [Dr. Yannis Trakadis](https://rimuhc.ca/-/yannis-trakadis) in psychiatric genomics, [Dr. Mallar Chakravarty](http://cobralab.ca/) in computational neuroscience and neuroimaging, and [Prof. Karl Friston](https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/~karl/) in theoretical neuroscience. These experiences have given me an appreciation for the wide variety of perspectives in the biological and neural-sciences.
